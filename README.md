## DAISEE: a new energy paradigm

We deeply believe that the **only** option to survive to the [Anthropocene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-l6FQN4P1c), in [a more complex and volatile world,](https://backchannel.com/joi-ito-explains-why-donald-trump-is-like-the-sex-pistols-943db42c9f47#.sj4pj8c39) is to consider _Energy as a_ [_Common\(s\)_](http://www.thenextsystem.org/commoning-as-a-transformative-social-paradigm/)_._

That’s why we have the ambition to bring energy door-to-door, like the internets have brought information \(and so much more\) at our doorstep, either from a centralized system or just from your neighbor. We want to foster resilient decentralized, secured and trusted energy infrastructures giving the power to the “[prosumers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosumer)” to freely decide how to share energy.

In practice, we’re working on several \(proto-\) designs of ‘open-source based secured decentralized autonomous energy organization systems’ and the deployment of trusted peer-to-peer energy infrastructures at micro scale.

## DAISEE : an open-design program

We bootstrap DAISEE in 2016 as an **open-design program** co-produced by [La M\[Y\]NE](http://lamyne.org) \(a ‘[tiers-lieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)’ based in [Lyon](http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1663048#map=10/45.7488/4.8766) dedicated to sustainable issues\) and [CELLABZ](http://cellabz.com/) \(a ‘labs builder’ who facilite the appropriation of all the emerging technologies\), with the very precious help of the [CitizenWatt](http://www.citizenwatt.paris) community.
