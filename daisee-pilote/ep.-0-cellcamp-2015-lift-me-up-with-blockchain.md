# Ep. 0 - CellCamp 2016 - Lift me up with blockchain

It's for sure that the DAISEE adventure has started long before all this.  In fact, it all began with a talk about with Clement and Nicolas about blockchain ... Indeed, at the end of 2015 ClÃ©ment and Nicolas has been following the "Sydney Blockchain Workshops" co-organized by [Cellabz](https://web.archive.org/web/20180105201128/http://cellabz.com/) and [COALA](https://www.coalaip.org/), and more specifically the "[Innovation Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c4VOrnsaiucLJY8r34XaTpF3IbIQzr27NdVH6fo8bJo/edit?usp=sharing)". It turns out that an energy project (Elethron) has picked or curiosity, and there starts the DAISEE story : what if we were working the - reductive topic - blockchain-energy in an citizenlab environment like [la MYNE](https://lamyne.org) ?
Thus, if we were to find a begining to all this, undoubtedly it was further our discussions early in 2016, during the three days of residence organized by Cellabz around the [2016 Lift conference](http://liftconference.com/) [blockchain track ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMsDozl4wjI)gathering curious minds on various topics and from diverse backgrounds.

## 1st step : jump in !

> From conference stage, to workshop, to private community masterclass : introduction to ethereum and DAO

We're a bunch of curious people, some that didn't know a thing about blockchain technologies (juste the philosophy and focntionning principle), others that had notions or even a bit of practice but all of us were excited to learn and practice, meet and discuss on the convergence of what we could call a "tech-community" (such as ethereum) with an "industrial or infrastructural sector" (such as energy). Well... you could argue - and you would be right - that ethereum is about infrastructure and energy about tech as well; but they're from different century or generation. The idea was then: is it relevant and how to work established, institionalized and "past-century" sectors (energy, mobility, law, science, health ...) through the blockchain prism.

We were firts introduced to blockchain and DAO by Stephan Tual

then by Joseph Lubin

and finally with Primavera de Filippi

all this giving us a glimps of the actual variety of the propositions and core technology.

We then went further into details with our guests and... some other ones with the workshop "[Blockchain and beyond](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/LIFT16-Blockchain-Beyond--A0MH~qVJbXes1rR_UdMYNCWrAQ-d56JxlAJYJTre8nTdn4oO)".

We ended-up the workshop on this slide, which will highly drive the vision model of an energy DAO in our thinking at DAISEE :
