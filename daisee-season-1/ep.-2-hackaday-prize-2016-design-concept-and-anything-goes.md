# Ep. 2 - Hackaday Prize 2016 : design, concept and anything goes

![Hackaday Prize : Design your concept &amp; Anything Goes](../.gitbook/assets/hackaday-prize-dcag.png)

## Preliminary note : what's are the "[Design your concept](https://cloud.lamyne.org/s/LecqqTARZqawjcY)" and "[Anything goes](https://cloud.lamyne.org/s/RGdoEcdezi3d7PS)" challenges about ?

### [Design your concept](https://web.archive.org/web/20160328233302/https://hackaday.io/prize/details)

> All problem solving starts with an idea or design concept to lead the way and provide direction for your design decision.

The Design Concept is the idea, it’s how you think about your project, it’s how you go about planning to solve the question you want to solve. It’s how you use your logic and creativity to move your design forward.

### [Anything goes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705044827/https://hackaday.io/prize/details)

> You are a non-confirmist, a misfit. You're an independant thinker, a troublemaker, and have no respect for the status quo. Build whatever you want.

## Design of our concept



## Anything goes : mission to Mars

### **Why Mission to Mars ?**

[SpaceX aims at sending people on Mars](https://storify.com/nicolasloubet/iac2016-spacex-mars) and we'll be needing to build the energy infrastructure on Mars in a way that is more sustainable and resilient than on Earth.

More over, Tesla is building the future of energy storage infrastructure and energy distribution network complementing the "well-known" "conventional" grid or micro-grid.

Then we think that, given the conditions on Mars and the necessity for energy production and distribution, DAISEE could be the future of the energy infrastructure on Mars.

### **Energy basics on Mars**

* No fossil fuel
* Solar energy \(about 50% of the earth's solar irradiation\)
* Wind power energy : Mars is a windy planet
* Nuclear fission/fusion since there are nuclear fuel on Mars
* Plant based electricity production
* Carbon dioxide sublimation \(solid to gas transformation\) &gt; energy generation

### **Grid infrastructure basics**

* Low pressure and gravity \(surface gravity: 38% of that on Earth...\)
* The Mars landers Viking I, Viking II, Pathfinder, Opportunity Rover, and Spirit Rover identified aluminium, iron, magnesium, and titanium in the Martian soil" \(see Wikipedia\), confirming that materials on site con be used to build the infrastructure
* Temperatures are very low, thus enabling more efficiency for electrical distribution systems.

We thought about this Mars project because it makes it possible to really think out of the box the potential application of DAISEE in a both new and known environment: new since it put some more constrains that we are not used to deal with, known because Mars is a planet with limited ressources as we know it on Earth. Thinking and building DAISEE on Mars, enables to think about innovative ways to distribute and exchange energy.
